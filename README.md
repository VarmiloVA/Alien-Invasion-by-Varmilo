# Alien-Invasion-by-Varmilo
The Alien Invasion game using Python and the pygame package.

In general: In Alien Invasion, the player controls the mothership. The player can control the mothership either  with WASD keysor the arrows for moving, and left mouse click for shooting. The player needs to destroy the ufos that are moving, if the user loses 3 lives the game is over 


To do: 

-Levels: the difficulty of the level will be based on the speed of the mothership and the speed of the ufos. 

-Main menu in which you can play two game modes: levels and custom. In "levels" you will have ~15 levels, when you complete all of them you will be able to use additional features and various skins. In custom you can select your speed and the enemy's speed. 

-Cosmetic products: when you have completed the ~15 levels, every bullet you shoot will be in a different color and you will be able to select the game background color.


The code is completed up to this point. Next steps are up to the user ;)
